# Student Report System

## Overview

This Python program is a student management system that allows you to store, retrieve, search, delete, and update student information in a text file. It's a command-line application, providing a menu-driven interface for performing various operations.  The program now includes robust input validation and error handling.

## Features

* **Add Student:** Add a new student's information (name, age, and marks) to the `students.txt` file. Input validation ensures that the provided data is of the correct type and within reasonable ranges using regular expressions.
* **View All Students:** Display the information of all students currently stored in the `students.txt` file. The program calculates and displays a basic result (Excellent, Good, Pass, or Fail) based on the student's marks.
* **Search Student by Name:** Search for a student by their name. If found, the program displays the student's details and result.
* **Delete Student by Name:** Delete a student's record from the `students.txt` file based on their name.
* **Update Student by Name:** Update a student's age and/or marks in the `students.txt` file based on their name.
* **Exit:** Terminate the program.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** (If you are using Git)

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd student-report-system  # Or the name of the directory
    ```
3.  **Run the program:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    (Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your Python script if it's different).
4.  **Interact with the Menu:** Follow the on-screen menu prompts to perform the desired operations.

## Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the Python code:

```python
import re  # Import the regular expression module

def get_student_info() -> str:
    """
    Prompts the user to enter student information (name, age, marks)
    and returns the information as a formatted string.
    Includes robust input validation using regular expressions.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing the student's name, age, and marks,
             separated by commas, and ending with a newline character.
             Returns an empty string if no information is entered.

        if not name:
            print("‚ùå Name cannot be empty")

        # Use regular expression for age validation (ensure it's a number >= 5)
        age = input("Enter Student's Age: ").strip()
        if not re.match(r"^\d+$", age) or int(age) < 5:
            print("‚ùå Invalid age. Must be a number >= 5.")

get_student_info() Function:This function gathers student details (name, age, and marks) from the user.It uses a while True loop to continuously prompt for input until valid data is entered.strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace from the input.Input validation is performed:Name cannot be empty.Age must be a digit and greater than or equal to 5.  This is checked using the regular expression r"^\d+$".Marks must be a digit and between 0 and 100 (inclusive). This is checked using the regular expression r"^\d+$".If any input is invalid, an error message is printed, and the continue statement restarts the loop.The function returns the validated data as a comma-separated string with a newline character at the end, suitable for writing to a file.def save_student(line: str, file_name: str = "students.txt") -> None:

main_menu() Function:This function displays the main menu of the program and handles user input.It uses a while True loop to keep displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.The menu options are:1: Add Student (calls get_student_info() and save_student())2: View All Students (calls read_students() and process_student_line())3: Exit (breaks the loop)4: Search Student by Name (calls search_student_by_name())5: Delete Student by Name (calls delete_student_by_name())6: Update Student by Name (calls update_student_by_name())The user's input is taken using input() and stripped of whitespace.An if-elif-else block is used to determine which function to call based on the user's choice.If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.if __name__ == "__main__"::This ensures that the main_menu() function is called only when the script is run directly, and not when imported as a module.File Structuremain.py: The main Python script containing the code.students.txt: A text file (automatically created) used to store student data. Each line in this file represents one student's record, with the name, age, and marks separated by commas.AssumptionsThe program assumes that the user will enter valid data when prompted. While there is input validation, the program may not be completely robust to all types of unexpected input.The program uses a simple text file (students.txt) for data storage. For more robust and scalable applications, a database would be more appropriate.The program does not handle concurrent access to the students.txt file. If multiple users or processes try to modify the file at the same time, data corruption could occur.Potential ImprovementsData Validation: The input validation could be made more sophisticated.Data Storage: Consider using a database (like SQLite) instead of a plain text file for more robust data storage.User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) could be created using a library like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy to make the program more user-friendly.Modularity: The code could be further modularized by breaking it down into more functions or classes.Comments: Adding more comments to the code would improve its readability and maintainability.Logging: Implementing logging would help in debugging and tracking program usage.Testing: Writing unit tests would help ensure the program's correctness and prevent regressions.Sorting: Add functionality to sort the student records (e.g., by name, age, or marks).
